## Description

A text editor for tech savy tech heads! I wanted to show what I had learned creating progressive web applications by making a text editor using next-gen javascript. It can be used offline, saves the content of the text editor when unfocused, and can be installed locally to your desktop as well.

## Installation

Run "npm run install" from command-line to install dependencies, and if deploying locally, "npm run start" as well

## Usage
This is a text editor application that you can use on any device. It has storage, can run offline, and be installed on your desktop.  
Here is a link to the application deployment on Heroku: [Application](YourURLHERE)  
![Preview Picture](YourPreviewScreenshot)
This application is useful for making comments and blogs using a functional progressive web app for blogging comments on all tech, new to old.
